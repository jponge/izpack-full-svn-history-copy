I have created an IzPack Groovy installer, containing:
    *	Groovy 1.5.4
    *	Documentation
    *	COM Scripting module
    *	Gant module
    *	GraphicsBuilder module

It installs (and uninstalls) shortcuts and file associations on Windows.

To build, you need to download the following from http://groovy.codehaus.org/,
into the downloads directory (or elsewhere):
    *	groovy-binary-1.5.4.zip
    *	groovy-docs-1.5.4.zip
    *	gant-1.1.1_groovy-1.5.4.zip
    *	scriptom-1.5.4.zip
    *	graphicsbuilder-0.5.1.zip

Set IZPACK_HOME to point at your IzPack-3.11.0 installation, then simply
invoke ant:

    ant -Dgroovy-zip.dir=downloads clean package

which creates the installer in build/groovy-1.5.4_installer.jar.

I have tested the installer on Windows XP and Mac OS X.

Notes
-----

This installer is "pure-Java", i.e., it does not leverage any Windows-specific
feature such as dealing with the registry and so on.

Also, please note that it only uses a minimal subset of the IzPack features :-)


How to generate an installer
----------------------------

Grab the official GlassFish installers from http://glassfish.org/

I recommend putting them in a directory called 'vendor', but you may well
proceed differently. The rest of the workflow is as follows.

1. Extract the installers contents to:

   * 'win32' for the Windows version
   * 'linux' for the Linux version
   * 'darwin' for the Mac OS X version
   * 'solaris_x86' for the Solaris x86 version
   * 'solaris_sparc' for the Solaris sparc version

2. Run the 'generate.rb' script. It requires Ruby 1.8.

3. Call IzPack on the generated 'glassfish-install.xml' IzPack descriptor.

4. Optionnaly, use 'izpack2exe' and 'izpack2app' to wrap the installer in
   a Windows self-extracting archive and in a Mac OS X application bundle.

   Please note that Windows VISTA may only provide a user rights escalation
   through a Windows executable named "liked an installer" (e.g., setup.exe).
   The traditional IzPack Jar installer may not be allowed to write to
   'Program Files' otherwise.

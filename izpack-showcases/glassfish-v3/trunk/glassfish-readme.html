<h3>About this distribution...</h3>
<p>This is <strong>not an official release</strong> of the GlassFish application server by Sun Microsystems. This is an independent repackaging made by Julien Ponge from the official GlassFish binaries packaging. This installer was generated using the opensource IzPack project (see <a href="http://izpack.org/">http://izpack.org/</a>).</p>

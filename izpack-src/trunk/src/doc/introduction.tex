\section*{Welcome to \IzPack !}

\parpic{\fbox{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/lang-sel-splash.eps}}}
\IzPack is a tool that will help you to solve your software installation
problems. It is a \Java based software installer builder that will run on any
operating system coming with a \textit{Java Virtual Machine (JVM)} that is
compliant with the Sun JVM 1.2 and more. Its design is very modular and you will
be able to choose how \textbf{you} want your installer to look like and you will
also be able to customize it using a very simple \textit{Application Programming
Interface (API)}. Although \IzPack is at first a \Java only application (it
can run on virtually any operating system), it can work in a clean way toward
the underlying operating system and some native code can interact with it on a
specific platform without disturbing the whole work on the incompatible ones.
For instance, you can develop a Unix-specific code that will be silent if run on
Windows. To put it in a nutshell, whereas most of the other \Java installers
force you to go their way, \IzPack will let you go \textbf{your way}. Some
respectable companies have been using it in order to produce some customized 
installers for their \textsl{very} specific needs.\\

\textit{"So, if it's so good, how much is it ?"} : well, you can get it for free.
\textbf{BUT} \IzPack is not a \textit{freeware}. It's not \textit{free} as in
\textit{"free beer"} but \textit{"free as in free speech"}. So it's neither
\textit{freeware} nor \textit{public domain}. It's a software covered by the
\textsc{GNU General Public License} (GPL). It uses the tactic of
\textit{copyleft} : to make it short, you can use it, modify it and redistribute
it freely but you must also make your modifications available to everyone
whenever your publish a modified version of a \textit{copylefted} software. You
have an access to the \IzPack source code and you can modify it to make it suit
your needs, but if you publish such a modified version, you are forced to
publish the modifications you've made. \underline{That's a fair expertise and 
work exchange}. To know more about the GPL license and the \textit{copyleft}
principles, visit \mbox{\url{http://www.gnu.org/}}.\\

% Features
\section*{The features}

\IzPack works using XML files to describe the installations. When you make an
installer, you will have the choice of your panels. You can see the panels as
a kind of plugins that compose the installer. For instance, a panel can choose
the installation path, the packs to install, prompt you for a license agreement
and so on. This approach is very modular and you can create your own panels if
you need to customize it. Moreover, you'll even have the choice of the panel for
a specific task as some are made for the same use and you'll choose their order
during the installation process. \IzPack can be use from several ways :
\begin{itemize}
	\item by writing the XML installation file "by hand" and compiling it from the
	command line compiler
	\item by invoking the compiler from the great \textsc{Apache Jakarta Ant} tool
	(see \url{http://jakarta.apache.org/}) as \IzPack can be used as a task for it
	\item by using the GUI based frontend to make both the XML file and the
	compilation process.
\end{itemize}\

Here is a brief (and certainly incomplete !) list of the main \IzPack features :
\begin{itemize}
	\item XML based installation files
	\item easy internationalisation using XML files (10 translations are already
	available)
	\item Ant integration, command-line compiler and GUI frontend
	\item easy customization with the panels and a rich API (even an XML parser is
	included !)
	\item powerfull variables substitution system that you can use to customize
	some scripts and more generally any text-based file
	\item different kind of installers (standard, web-based, ...)
	\item executables launching during the installation process and Unix
	executable flag support (usefull for the scripts for instance)
	\item layout of the installation files in packs (some can be optionnal)
	\item native code integration facilities
	\item jar files nesting support
	\item ... \textsl{more stuffs to discover and create !}.
\end{itemize}\

% Development
\section*{The development}

I have started writing \IzPack in April 2001 and many people have helped me
improving it since. I prefer not to mention them here as I would for sure forget
some of them, so please check the file named \texttt{Thanks.txt} which I try to
get as up-to-date as possible toward mentionning everyone that helped me. As far
as I'm concerned, I'm a french student and I rather see this as a fun activity
on my free time where I can learn a lot of great things. The contributors to the
project are both individuals and companies. The help can take any form :
\begin{itemize}
	\item translations
	\item new features and various fixes
	\item bug fixes
	\item manuals
	\item ... anything else you like :-)
\end{itemize}\

The official \IzPack homepage is located at
\mbox{\url{http://www.izforge.com/izpack/}}. There is a mailing-list available 
(\url{izpack.ml@izforge.com}) and you can subscribe to it by sending an email to
\url{izpack.ml_request@izforge.com} and typing \texttt{subscribe} in the 
subject field. Consider the mailing-list as the best way to get some help about
IzPack and submitting new ideas and contributions.\\

The releases of \IzPack are in 2 parts :
\begin{itemize}
	\item a \textit{stable} release that is ready for a production use
	\item an \textit{unstable} release that may contain bugs and miscompleted
	features, it is the result of regular CVS snapshots.
\end{itemize}\

To access the CVS, please use this \texttt{CVSROOT} :\\
\texttt{':pserver:anonymous@cvs.tuxfamily.org:/cvsroot/izpack2'}. A \textbf{BIG}
thank to the TuxFamily team (see \url{http://www.tuxfamily.org/}). If you need a
read/write access to contribute to \IzPack, then ask me for such an access at
\url{julien@izforge.com}. Of course don't forget to replace \texttt{'anonymous'}
by your login. There are 2 modules in this CVS :
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{langpacks} : contains the translations (same as
	\texttt{bin/langpacks} in your \IzPack installation directory
	\item \texttt{src} : contains the source code (same as \texttt{src/} in your
	\IzPack installation directory.
\end{itemize}\

% 3rd party used
\section*{3rd party code used in \IzPack}

\IzPack uses some 3rd party libraries and I would like to mention them by
respect to their respective authors work :
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{NanoXML} by Marc \textsc{De Scheemaecker} : the XML parser used
	inside \IzPack and released under a \textit{zlib/png}-style license - see\\
	\url{http://nanoxml.sourceforge.net/} -
	\item \textit{Kunststoff Look and Feel} by Incors Gmbh : a Swing\texttrademark 
	\ Look and Feel
	that can be used for some installers that \textbf{really} looks good and that 
	is released under the \textsc{GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)} - see
	\url{http://www.incors.org/} -
	\item \textit{Swing Connection Icons} : the icons used in \IzPack come from
	the \Java section of the Sun website - see \url{http://java.sun.com/} -
	\item \textit{Jakarta Ant DirectoryScanner class} : allows the use of Ant
	filesets syntax support. 
\end{itemize}\

So now, let's dive into the understanding of how \IzPack works. You'll be
surprised to see how powerfull and simple it can be :-)

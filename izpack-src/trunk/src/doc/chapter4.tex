\section{Defining Shortcuts}

\subsection{Introduction}

On today's operating systems, users are used to launching applications,
view web sites, look at documentation and perform a variety of other
tasks, by simply clicking on an icon on the desktop or in menu system
located on the desktop. Depending on the operating system these icons
have different names. In this context I will refer to them collectively
as shortcuts.\\

Apart from actually placing an application on the target system, users
routinely expect an installer to create the necessary shortcuts for the
application as well. For you as application developer, this means that
for a professional appearance of your application you should also
consider creating shortcuts for your application.\\

In contrast to the general specification of an IzPack installer, the
specification of shortcuts in IzPack requires a little more effort. In
addition, some of the concepts are a bit more complex and there are some
operating specific issues to observe. Fortunately, you only need to
worry about operating system specifics if you want to deploy your
application to multiple different operating systems. In any case, it
will pay off to spend some time to study this documentation and the
example spec file before you start to implement your shortcuts.\\

At the time of this writing (for IzPack version 3.0) IzPack is only
capable of creating shortcuts on the Microsoft Windows operating systems
[Win95 and higher and Win-NT 4.0 and higher]. Other operating systems,
such as Mac and UNIX flavors are not directly supported. However, there
is a special UI that automatically pops up on unsupported systems. It
informs the user about the intended targets of your shortcuts and allows
the user to save this information to a text file. While this is not an
elegant solution, at least it aids the user in the manual creation of
the shortcuts.\\

If you would like to review what an end user would see if the target
operating system is not supported, you can do the following. Simply
place the tag \texttt{<notSupported/>} in the spec file. This tag requires no
attributes or other data. It must be placed under \texttt{<shortcuts>}, just like
the individual shortcut specifications. Be sure to remove this tag
before getting your application ready for shipment.\\

We expect other operating systems to be supported in the near future and
as always, contributions are very welcome.\\

\subsection{What to Add to the Installer}

There are a number of things that you must add to the installer to make
it ready for creating shortcuts. Obviously you need to add the panel
responsible for creating shortcuts. This panel is aptly enough called
ShortcutPanel. However, in order for the ShortcutPanel to function
properly a number of additional items are required. These must be added
manually to the installer, because the front-end does not support this
feature yet. In this chapter I will explain which of these items are
required and for what reason.\\

First, I would like to discuss items that are supplied with IzPack and
only need to be added to the installer. After that, I move on to the
things you have to prepare yourself before you can add them. The way in
which shortcuts are actually created varies widely among operating
systems. In some cases it is actually possible to do this with pure Java
code, while other systems -such as MS-Windows- require native code to
accomplish this task. The native libraries required for the supported
operating systems are supplied with IzPack but they are not
automatically added to your installer file. You need to list them
yourself in the XML file for the installer. I'll describe later how to
do this. At the time of this writing (for IzPack version 3.0) only
MS-Windows is supported. The native library required for this operating
system is called ShellLink.dll.\\

Adding libraries to the installer is made through the \texttt{<native>} tag so
here you'll just have to specify :\\
\texttt{<native type="izpack" name="ShellLink.dll"/>}\\

You have to supply an extra specification file for the shortcuts that
you want to be  created on the target system. The format for this spec
file is XML. This XML file must be added to the installer as a resource.
The source name of this specification does not matter, however its name
when added to the installer must be shortcutSpec.xml. This is the name
the ShortcutPanel looks for. If the specification file can not be found,
the ShortcutPanel will not show at all.\\

\subsection{The Shortcut Specification}

The specification for shortcuts is provided to the ShortcutPanel in the
form of a XML file. At the time of this writing (for IzPack version 3.0)
the front-end has no support for generating this specification. Until a
later version provides front-end support you will have to write the
specification manually. For your convenience, an annotated sample
specification is located in the sample subdirectory of your IzPack
installation. At the beginning you might want to experiment with this
file.\\

The specification file has only one major section called \texttt{<shortcuts>}.
In this section, two different tags are recognized: \texttt{<programGroup>} and
\texttt{<shortcut>}.\\

The \texttt{<programGroup>} tag allows you to specify the name of the menu under
which the shortcuts will be grouped. The exact location and appearance
of the program group depends on the specific target system on which the
application will be installed, however you have some influence on this.
Please note that \texttt{<programGroup>} may only appear once in the
specification. If more than one instance occurs, only the first one will
be used. This tag requires two attributes: 'defaultName' and 'location'.
'defaultName' specifies the name that the group menu should have on the
target system. You should be aware that the ShortcutPanel will present
this name to the user as a choice. The user can then edit this name or
select a group that already exists. As a result, there is no guarantee
that the actual name of the program group on the target system is
identical with your specification. 'location' specifies where the group
menu should show up. There are two choices: applications and startMenu.
If you use applications, then the menu will be placed in the menu that
is ordinarily used for application shortcuts. If you use startMenu, the
group menu will be placed at the top most menu level available on the
target system. Depending on the target system it might not be possible
to honor this specification exactly. In such cases, the ShortcutPanel
will map the choice to the location that most closely resembles your
choice.\\

For each shortcut you want to create, add one \texttt{<shortcut>} tag. Most
details about the shortcut are listed as attributes with this tag. The
following sections describe what each attribute does, which attributes
are optional and which ones are required and what the values are that
are accepted for each of the attributes. Note that all attributes that
have a yes/no choice can also be omitted. Doing so has the same effect
as using a value of no.\\

\textbf{name}\\

The value of this attribute defines the name that the shortcut will
have. This is the text that makes up the menu name if the shortcut is
placed in a menu or the caption that is displayed with the shortcut if
it is placed on the desktop.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item required
\end{itemize}\

\textbf{programGroup}\\

The value for this attribute can be either yes or no. Any other value
will be interpreted as no. If the value is yes, then a copy of this
shortcut will be placed in the group menu.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item optional
\end{itemize}\

\textbf{desktop}\\

For this attribute the value should also be yes or no. If the value is
yes, then a copy of the shortcut is placed on the desktop.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item optional
\end{itemize}\

\textbf{applications}\\

This is also a yes/no attribute. If the value is yes, then a copy of the
shortcut is placed in the applications menu (if the target operating
system supports this). This is the same location as the applications
choice for the program group.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item optional
\end{itemize}\

\textbf{startMenu}\\

This is a yes/no attribute as well. If the value is yes, then a copy of
the shortcut is placed directly in the top most menu that is available
for placing application shortcuts.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item optional
\end{itemize}\

\textbf{startup}\\

This is also a yes/no attribute. If the value is yes, then a copy of the
shortcut is placed in a location where all applications get automatically
started at OS launch time, if this is available on the target OS.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item optional
\end{itemize}\

\textbf{target}\\

The value if this attribute points to the application that should be
launched when the shortcut is clicked. The value is translated through
the variable substitutor. Therefore variables such as \$INSTALL\_PATH can
be used to describe the location. \textbf{You should be aware that the use of
this tag is likely to change once other operating systems are
supported}.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item reqired
\end{itemize}\

\textbf{commandLine}\\

The value of this attribute will be passed to the application as command
line. I recommend to work without command line arguments, since these are
not supported by all operating systems. As a result your applications
will not be portable if they depend on command line arguments. Instead,
consider using system properties or configuration files.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item optional
\end{itemize}\

\textbf{description}\\

The value of this attribute will be visible to the user when a brief
description about this application is requested. The form of the
request and the way in which this description is displayed varies
between operating systems. On MS-Windows the description is shown as a
tool tip when the mouse cursor hovers over the icon for a few seconds.\\

\textbf{iconFile}\\

The value of this attribute points to the file that holds an icon which
should be displayed as a symbol for this shortcut. This value is also
translated through the variable substitutor and consequently can contain
variables such as \$INSTALL\_PATH. If this attribute is omitted, no icon
will be specified for the shortcut. Usually this causes the OS to
display an OS supplied default icon. \textbf{The use of this attribute is also
likely to chance once other operating systems are supported}.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item optional
\end{itemize}\

\textbf{iconIndex}\\

If the file type for the icon supports multiple icons in one file, then
this attribute may be used to specify the correct index for the icon. I
would also advise against using this feature, because of operating
system incompatibilities in this area. In file formats that do not
support multiple icons, this values is ignored.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item optional
\end{itemize}\

\textbf{initialState}\\

There are four values accepted for this attribute: noShow, normal,
maximized and minimized. If the target operating system supports this
feature, then this value will have the appropriate influence on the
initial window state of the application. noShow is particularly useful
when launch scripts are used that cause command window to open, because
the command window will not be visible with this option. For instance on
MS-Windows starting a batch file that launches a Java application has
the less than pretty side effect that two windows show: the DOS command
prompt and the Java application window. Even if the shortcut is
configured to show minimized, there are buttons for both windows in the
task bar. Using noShow will completely eliminate this, only the Java
application window will be visible.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item optional
\end{itemize}\

\subsection{Selective Creation of Shortcuts}

Usually all shortcuts that are listed will be created when the user
clicks the 'Create Shortcuts' button. However it is possible to control
to some degree if specific shortcuts should be created or not. This is
based on install conditions. By including one or more \texttt{<createForPack>}
tags in the specification for a shortcut, you can direct the
ShortcutPanel to create the shortcut only if any of the listed packs are
actually installed. The 'name' attribute is used to define the name of
one of the packs for which the shortcut should be created. You do not
need to list all packs if a shortcut should always be created. In this
case simply omit this tag altogether.\\

\section{Shortcut Tips}

I wrote this section to provide additional information about
issues surrounding the creation of shortcuts. None of this is necessary
to successfully create shortcuts but it might help you creating an
installation that works more smoothly. In addition, it might give you
some knowledge about operating systems that you don't know so well. In
fact most of the issues described in this section are focused on
operating system specifics.\\

\subsection{The Desktop}

You should recognize that the desktop is precious real estate for many
people. They like to keep it uncluttered and keep only the things there
that they use on a regular basis. This is not true for everybody and you
might personally think different about this. Still, the fact remains
that a lot of people migth have different feelings about it, so you
should not automatically assume that it is ok to place all of your
shortcuts on the desktop proper. While your application is certainly one
of the most important things for you, for your customers it is probably
one of many applications they use and maybe not even the most important one.
Accordingly, placing more shortcut icons there than they feel they will
use regularly and especially doing this without asking for permision
might trigger some bad temper.\\

It is common practice to create a program group on the application menu
system of the OS and place all shortcuts that go with an application in
that program group. In addition, only one shortcut to the key access
point of the application is placed directly on the desktop. Many
installers first ask for permission to do so, as does the ShortcutPanel
in IzPack.\\

I would like to recommend that you always create a shortcut in the menu
system, even if your application has only one access point and you are
placing this on the desktop. Note that shortcuts can be placed directly
in the menu, they don't need to be in a program group. There are two
reasons for doing so.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item If the user elects not to create shortcuts on the desktop, they
      will end up with no access point to your application
\item Even if this works fine, occasionally people 'clean up' their
      desktop. They migth later find that they accidentally deleted the
      only access point to your application. For the less tech savvy
      users, recreating the shortcut might be a rough experience.
\end{itemize}\

\subsection{Icons}

Icons are supplied in image files, usually in some kind of bitmap
format. Unfortunately there is no format that is universally recognized
by all operating systems. If you would like to create shortcuts on a
variety of operating systems that use your own icons, you must supply
each icon in a number of different formats. This chapter discusses icon
file formats used on various operating systems. Fortunately there are
good programs available that allow you to convert between these formats,
so that creating the different files is not much of a problem once the
icons themselfes are created.\\

\textbf{Microsoft Windows}\\

Windows prefers to use its native icon file format. Files of this type
usually use the extension *.ico. Icon files can hold multiple icons in
one file, which can be useful if the same icon is to be provided in a
number of sizes. The iconIndex attribute in the spec file allows you to
specify which of the icons to use.\\

Windows also supports the use of bitmap files in the *.bmp format as
icons. Note that this format does not support multiple icons.\\

I am not a total expert in this area and might have overlookd other file
formats that are supported by Windows. However, I would suggest to test
other formats for compatibility as they might not work all the way back
to Windows 95 or on the NT/non-NT strain. Sticking with one of these two
formats should keep you out of trouble.\\

\textbf{Apple}\\

Apple Macintosh systems use the Macintosh PICT format, extension *.pct.
If you are working with an apple system you know a whole lot more about
this format than I do. If you don't but would like to be able to install
your application on a Mac, simply start with any bitmap format that you
feel comfortable to work with. Then find an application that is capable
of converting this format into a *.pct file. I like to use Paint Shop
Pro (PC based), because it provides conversion capabilities among
several dozen different file formats.\\

\textbf{UNIX flavors}\\

\textit{Elmar said :}\\
Sorry, folks I have no information available at this time.
Any addition is most welcome.\\

\textit{Julien says :}\\
Everything depends of the Window Manager that you use. A common thing is that
Unix users get a graphical interface through a X11-compatible Window Manager.
However they are almost incompatible with each other. Often they consist of
blind text files to create or edit somewhere on the system and/or in the user
account. The KDE shortcuts system is a model of good sense. I will add the
support for it in a future \IzPack version.\\

\subsection{Targets}

So, you thought you could escape the ugly mess of operating system
dependencies at least with the way how your Java application is started?
Sorry but I have just another bad message. The one positive thing is
that here you have a way of escaping, even if doing so has a few less
pretty side effects. At first, I would like to discuss various launching
options you have available on different operating systems. At the end of
the chapter I write about a way to make launching your application OS
independent.\\

\textbf{Microsoft Windows}\\

On Microsoft windows you have a variety of options for launching your
application. Probably the most simple case directly starting the Java VM
from the command line and typing out all parameters, such as calss path,
the class name etc. In principle, this can be stuck right into a
shortcut and should work.\\

A little more elagant solution is to place this in a batch file and have
the shortcut point to this batch file. This will also make it more
likely that users can repair or recreate shortcuts. Recreating shortcuts
with sophisticated command lines is practically impossible.\\

Another method is less comonly used but just as possible. Implement a
native executable that launches the VM with your Java application. The
VM comes as DLL and is used by java.exe in just the same way.\\

Clearly, even though the first option is a bit ugly and has some
drawbacks, it is the most portable solution among the three.\\

\textbf{Apple}\\

\textbf{UNIX}\\

UNIX provides essentailly the same options as Windows. You can simply
use the command line option, you can write a shell script and you can
write a native launcher. Naturally this stuff is in now way compatible
with the equivalent Windows implementations. The native options is even
more problematic in this environment, since the code can not even moved
from one UNIX hardware platform to another, without recompilation.\\

\textbf{OS Independent Launching}\\

So, after all this rather discouraging news, there is actually a
portable way to launch Java applications? You bet! although I have to
admit that it is not necessarily the most pretty way of doing things.\\

This approach is actually used by IzPack. Package your application in a
*.jar file if you don't already do so and make it executable. I am not
going into all the details on how exactly to do this, the Java
documentation will have to do. You might have noticed that even though
the instructions to install IzPack say to type :
\begin{verbatim}
java -jar IzPack-install.jar
\end{verbatim}\

You can just as well double click on IzPack-install.jar and it will
start up. This procedure will work on all Java supported operating
systems -though you might have to replace double clicking with dropping
the file on the VM. In just the same way, you can make the *.jar file
itself the target of a shortcut.\\

The one drawback with this approach is that a *.jar file can only have
one main file. So, if you have multiple targets, they need to be
packaged each into a different *.jar file. They can be in one *.jar file
but then you have to start them explicitely, which gets you back to the
problems that I mentioned before. This brings me to the ugly part. If
you have just one target, you are all set. If you have multiple targets,
you need to create a *.jar file for each. In addition, you have a much
harder time setting the classpath, because each of the *.jar files that
contain supporting code must be listed. In fact, at present there is no
way of setting this during the installation, because IzPack does not yet
(version 3.0) support the setting and modification of environment
variables.\\

\subsection{Command Line}

Before I start to write a lot about the use of command line arguments
let me state this: If you can avoide using them, do it! Not that there
is anything wrong with command line arguments as such. The issue is
simply that if you want your application to be usable cross platform
(the big Java promise) you should shy away from using command line
arguments. The problem here is that not all operating systems actually
support command line arguments. To be more precise, to my knowledge only
Apple operating systems do not support command line parameters. If you
don't care for running your application on a Mac, then you might not
worry about his at all. If you are intereseted to support the Mac as
well, read on.\\

In fact the Mac sopports command line parameters in a way. More to the
point, it supports a single parameter that your pplication should
interpret as the name of a data file to open. You have no way of
supplying this to your application through the command line atribute.
The operating system generates this when the user drops the file on your
application and then passes it as command line argument. That's it. This
same bahavior will probably fly well on pretty much any system and
should therefore be an ok implementation.\\

So what to do if you want to modify program behavior based on run-time
switches? For one thing,  could set system properties accordingly.
The drawback here is the same as with the command line parameters: the
way of setting these might vary between operating systems. The best way
to me seems to be using a property file that contains the configuration
data.\\

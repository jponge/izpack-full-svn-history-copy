Custom Actions
==========================

(by Klaus BARTZ)


Overview
=====

The implementation of custom actions presume knowledge of java. Custom
actions are not a good starting point for learning java. Learners can use
existent custom actions but should not implement them as exercise.

In general the installation procedure is separated into several steps. The
first step, let's call it the *data collection phase*, is getting specific
data needed for the installation process. Typically this is done by typing
all neded data into one or more panels, if a GUI is used, or automatically by
reading the data from a config file. In general nothing will be changed on
the system until all needed data is obtained. But mostly - depending on to
the information, e.g. the destination path - different input panels are
involved.

If all needed data is collected the second step will be perfomed, let us call
it the *action phase*. During this step the state of the locale machine will
be changed, e.g. files will be copied to the installation destination or some
short cuts will be registered. Each of this subsequent steps are denoted as
actions. There are actions intended to be reused, so called common actions,
and actions for one special purpose only, so called custom actions. In IzPack
there are already some common actions, for example "file transfer", "parse"
or "execute".

The third step, the *reporting phase*, is normally represented by a panel
that reports the result state of the installation (OK, or not OK) and a
simple good bye message.

With IzPack there are two ways to implement custom actions. Firstly it is
always possible to define a custom panel that perfoms the desired actions
too. Secondly, and that's the new, custom actions are supported.

Panels still may be used for actions that are perfomed, e.g. before files are
transferred or after the "execute" action. But if the needed action depends
on the selected or already installed packages, this works also, but the
implementation effort is much higher.

If the action should be performed for several amount of elements of a pack,
using custom actions will be more easy than using panels. Additional custom
actions may be defined for installation, but also for packaging and
uninstallation purposes. If a custom action is also needed for uninstallation
purposes, it'll be always a good idea to implement a corresponding
installation action as custom action, but not as panel.


How It Works
=====

Custom actions are implemented as listeners. Each listener implements
callback methods that will be called at well-defined points. The method
``InstallerListener.afterFile`` for example will be called after a file has
been copied. There are different interfaces intended for being used at
packaging time, at installation time and at uninstallation time.

Each interface is implemented by a class with the prefix "Simple" (e.g.
SimpleCompilerListener) that implements all declared interface methods with
an empty body. These classes may be used as base classes for own listener
implementations.

To apply custom actions to the installer, an entry in the apropriate
install.xml file is needed. The configuration of listeners starts with the
facultative ELEMENT "listeners" which can contain one or more ELEMENTs of
"listener". For a "listener" there are three attributes which determine the
"compiler", "installer" and "uninstaller" custom action pupose. Additionally
it is possible to make the listener OS dependent using the "os" ELEMENT.

If file related data will be set, the facultative ELEMENT "additionaldata" is
defined for the ELEMENTs "file", "singlefile" and "fileset". This data will
be automatically moved to the corresponding PackFile objects in the
install.jar. Extraction and usage should be implemented in a install custom
action (see example).


Custom Action Types
-----

Custom actions are intended to be used at packaging time, at installation
time and at uninstallation time. The interfaces are:

*Custom action type* *Interface name*
Packaging  com.izforge.izpack.event.CompilerListener
Installation  com.izforge.izpack.event.InstallerListener
Uninstallation  com.izforge.izpack.event.UninstallerListener


Custom Actions At Packaging
~~~~~


UML Diagram

    :alt: \fbox{\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{img/CompilerListener}}



Description
:::::

-   *(constructor)*: only the default constructor will be used. It is
    called from Compiler just after creating the packager. Therefore
    initializing will be better during in the first ``notify`` call.
-   ``reviseAdditionalDataMap`` gives the facility to add data to each
    ``PackFile`` object. This is the place where file related data can be
    transferred from the install xml file into the install jar file. Although
    each key and value of the map can be any type, but the class definitions
    of all used types must therfore be contained in the installer jar file or
    in the VM's classpath. In general strings are the best choice for being
    used as keys or values. All keys must be unique over all registered
    ``CompilerListeners``. Each call of this method adds own key value pairs
    to the given ``existenDataMap`` because more than one listener can be
    used. If the given map is null, a new one will be created.
-   ``notify`` is called at the beginning and at the end of each "add"
    method call which is called in ``Compiler.executeCompiler``.


Custom Actions At Installing Time
~~~~~


UML Diagram
:::::

.. image:: img13.png
    :alt: \fbox{\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{img/InstallerListener}}



Description
:::::

-   *(constructor)*: only the default constructor will be used. It is
    called from ``Unpacker.run`` before unpacking.
-   ``beforePacks`` will be called each time before an unpacking call is
    performed.
-   ``beforePack`` is called before a package is installed. Pack object
    and the number of the pack are passed.
-   ``isFileListener`` determines whether the next four methods are
    called or not. This is a little performance optimizing.
-   ``beforeDir`` is called before a directory is created. In this case,
    when file listeners exist, directories are created recursively and the
    method is called at each step. The file and the current ``PackFile``
    object are passed.
-   ``afterDir`` is called directly after the directory creation.
-   ``beforeFile`` is called before a file is created. The file and
    ``PackFile`` object are passed as parameters.
-   ``afterFile`` is the best place to perform file related actions. The
    given ``PackFile`` objects contains the additional data which was set at
    packaging.
-   ``afterPack`` will be just called after the pack is closed.
-   ``afterPacks`` is the last step before the handler will be stopped.


Custom Actions At Uninstalling Time
~~~~~


UML Diagram
:::::

.. image:: img14.png
    :alt: \fbox{\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{img/UninstallerListener}}



Description
:::::

-   *(constructor)* : only the default constructor will be used. It is
    called from ``Destroyer.run`` as first call.
-   ``beforeDeletion`` will be called after execute files was performed.
    The given list contains all *File* objects which are marked for deletion.
-   ``isFileListener`` determines whether the next two methods are called
    or not.
-   ``beforeDelete`` is the method which, is called before a single file
    is deleted. The *File* object is given as parameter.
-   ``afterDelete`` will be invoked after the delete call for a single
    file.
-   ``afterDeletion`` is the last call before the cleanup of created data
    is performed.


Package Path
-----

Custom actions must always implement one of the given listener interfaces. As
mentioned above, it is also possible to derive from one of the "Simple"
listeners. The package path is facultative, only the class name must be
unique over all custom actions. The preparation of a custom action for
providing it with an installation is very similar to panels. Custom actions
must also be packed into a jar file with the name of the custom action class
name. This jar file should be placed in ``[IzPackRoot]/bin/customActions``,
may be

::
    [IzPackRoot]/bin/customActions/MyCompilerListener.jar
    [IzPackRoot]/bin/customActions/MyInstallerListener.jar
    [IzPackRoot]/bin/customActions/MyUninstallerListener.jar


In the default Ant definition file (build.xml) there are some targets for
this stuff.


Correlated Stuff
-----


Native Libraries for Uninstallation
~~~~~

If a custom action uses JNI at installation time, often the associated
uninstall custom action needs JNI too. For this situation it is possible to
declare a native library for unstallation. The only work to do is to add a
``stage`` attribute to the ``native`` tag in the install xml file like

::
    <!-- The native section. We specify here our os dependant
    libs..--> <native type="3rdparty"
    name="MyOSHelper.dll"stage="both" >
       <os family="windows" />
    </native>


The needed additional classes are packed into lib/uninstaller-ext.jar. If a
native library is defined for uninstallation, this file will also be packed
into the installer.jar as IzPack.unistaller-ext and used at its right
position.


What You Have To Do
=====

Follow the steps that are needed to create and use custom actions with the
"normal" source environment (not standalone compiler) using Ant. Of course,
it works also with the standalone compiler.



Custom Actions at Packaging (CompilerListener)
----------------------------------------------------------

-   Implement ``com.izforge.izpack.event.CompilerListener`` or extend
    ``com.izforge.izpack.event.SimpleCompilerListener``. Place it as ``
    [IzPackRoot]/src/lib/[MyPackagePath]/MyCompilerListener.java``.
-   Add a "``build-compiler-listener``" macro call in to the
    ``build.listeners`` target in ``[IzPackRoot]/src/build.xml``. Note that
    the name attribute value in the build-instealler-listener must match
    ``CompilerListener`` implementation class name (not including the
    package). You should include the actual Listener implementation, as well
    as any other classes required by the listener. ::
                <build-compiler-listener
                name="MyCompilerListener">
                    <include
                    name="[MyPackagePath]/MyCompilerListener.java"/>
                    <include
                    name="[MyPackagePath]/SomeOtherHelperClass.java"/>
                </build-compiler-listener>

-   Run ``[IzPackRoot]/src/build.xml``. An ``ant`` alone will execute the
    required targets.
-   Add a "listeners" ELEMENT with a "listener" ELEMENT with a "compiler"
    attribute in to [MyProjectPath]/install.xml ::
          <listeners>
            <listener compiler="MyCompilerListener" />
          <listeners>

-   Compile with the following command, or an ant task you have set up.
    ::
        java -jar [IzPackRoot]/lib/compiler.jar -HOME [IzPackRoot]
          [MyProjectPath]/install.xml -b [MyProductPath] -o
          [MyBuildPath]/install.jar

-   Test it


Custom Actions at Installation Time (InstallerListener)
-----

Perform the same steps as described in `7.3.1`_, replace all occurrences of
"CompilerListener" with "InstallerListener" and "compiler" with "installer".


Custom Actions at Uninstallation Time (UninstallerListener)
-----

Perform the same steps as described in `7.3.1`_, replace all occurrences of
"CompilerListener" with "UninstallerListener"and "compiler" with
"uninstaller".


Example
=====

Let us say, we want to set access rights for files and directories on Unix.
The Java sources are placed in the directory
``[IzPackRoot]/sample/src/com/myCompany/tools/install/listener``. There are
the files ChmodCompilerListener.java and ChmodInstallerListener.java.

-   Copy the files too
    [IzPackRoot]/src/lib/com/myCompany/tools/install/listener
-   In [IzPackRoot]/src/build.xml there are the lines ::
            <!-- CUSTOM ACTION test START
            CUSTOM ACTION test END -->
         Uncomment them (activate the lines between them).
-   Build IzPack new.
-   Compile a test installation with ::
        java -jar [IzPackRoot]/lib/compiler.jar -HOME [IzPackRoot]
          [IzPackRoot]/sample/listener/install.xml
          -b [IzPackRoot]/sample/listener -o
          [IzPackRoot]/sample/listener/install.jar

-   Install it ::
        java -jar install.jar



Ant Actions (InstallerListener and UninstallerListener)
=====

In this section the common ant task custom actions are described in detail.
It is only for developers who are not acquainted with ``IzPack`` or it's
custom actions. In addition to the basics there are some recapitulations of
the common custom action techniques and some hints for pitfalls.
In the package ``com.izforge.izpack.event`` there are the ant related custom
actions ``AntActionInstallerListener`` and ``AntActionUninstallerListener``.
As recapitulation, to add any custom action a reference in install.xml will
be needed, as example:


::
    <listeners>
        <listener installer="AntActionInstallerListener"
            uninstaller="AntActionUninstallerListener" />
    </listeners>


For all referenced listeners a jar file with the same name must exist in
``[IzPackRoot]/bin/customActions``. If compilation (packaging) fails with a
"not found" error, first verify, that the jar file exists. If not, create it.
With this custom action it is possible to perform ant calls at installation
and/or uninstallation time. It is not only a wrapper for a comand-line ant
call, but also an intersected description file defining what target of the
ant build file should be performed at what time of (un)installation and
specifies which properties for what IzPack ``pack`` are to be used. The
intersected description file is written as XML, the corresponding dtd is
placed in src/dtd/event/antaction.dtd. The description file should be
declared as a resource in the install.xml with the id `` AntActionsSpec.xml``
e.g.


::
    <resorces>
        ...
        <res id="AntActionsSpec.xml"
        src="myInstallSpecs/MyAntActionsSpec.xml" />
        ...
    </resorces>


The precise spelling of the id is important. The base path of ``src`` is the
installation project path. If you want to use ant, you have to specify it
here. IzPack is designed for running without dependencies on external
software or libraries. Therefore it is necessary to include everything
needed, in this case ant self. The field ``<jar>`` in installation.xml is
predestinated for such cases, e.g.


::
    <jar src="jar/ant/ant.jar" stage="both" />


Be aware, that an "extended" ant use needs more than one jar, for example
often ``xercesImpl.jar``. If an obscure "class not found" exception is raised
during testing, check first for missing jar files.
For supporting uninstallation the jar field was extended by the attribute
``stage``. If an ant uninstaller custom action is used, the uninstaller also
needs the jar files. If `` stage`` is "both" or "uninstall", the contents of
the referenced jar file will be packed into uninstaller.jar. Be aware that
not the jar file itself, but the contents of it are required. This implies,
that the paths of the contained files are unique and the information in
``meta-inf/Manifest.mf`` will be lost.



The Basic XML Struture
-----

An ant action will be defined in the resource with the id
"AntActionsSpec.xml". Sometimes it will help to lock into
``[IzPackRoot]/src/dtd/event/antaction.dtd`` or validate a written xml file
with the dtd.

On this xml file a substitution will be performed using all defined
``IzPack`` variables. It is performed just before processing the packs. This
is a common way of loading spec files into custom actions. For more
information see method ``com.izforge.izpack.util.SpecHelper.readSpec``. If
you want to substitute some custom item, simply add a variable via
idata.setVariable in a custom panel before ``InstallPanel``. The given
variable name (id) should be written into the xml file in the common variable
notation.

The top level XML section is called ``<antactions>``. Only one is possible.
The ``<antactions>`` are segregated in one or more ``<pack>`` elements. The
single attribute ``<name>`` of the ``<pack>`` corresponds to the same
structure in install.xml (for more information see also installation.dtd).
Only the "things" included in the ``<pack>`` are performed, if a pack with
the same name was chosen to be installed. The "things" to be done to self are
defined by the element ``<antcall>`` (without ssss).

The ``<antcall>`` takes the following attributes:

-   ``order``: required. Determine at what point of installation the
    antcalls defined by element ``target`` should be performed. Possible are
    ``beforepack``, ``afterpack``, ``beforepacks`` or ``afterpacks``. Be
    aware that with beforepack(s) there are no installed files and also no
    installed build file. With this order only preexistent build files are
    useable.
-   ``uninstall_order``: optional. Determine at what point of
    uninstallation the antcalls defined by element ``uninstall_target``
    should be performed. Possible are ``beforedeletion`` and
    ``afterdeletion``. As opposed to the behaviour of ``order`` the
    referenced files are also accessible in the order ``afterdeletion``. The
    uninstaller action copies the files into tempfiles before deletion which
    are marked as deleteOnExit.
-   ``quiet``: optional. To quit or not. Possible are yes or no. Default
    is no.
-   ``verbose``: optional. To output verbose information or not. Possible
    are yes or no. Default is no.
-   ``logfile``: optional. Path of the file for logging should be
    performed. The logfile should be not marked for uninstallation otherwise
    it will be deleted too.
-   ``buildfile``: required. Path of the file which contains the antcall.
    This is the file you normally use as ``-buildfile`` during an ant call
    via the command line. In this file variables are not substituted. For
    substitution there are properties in ant which can be used. Never write
    an ``IzPack`` variable in an ant buildfile.
-   ``messageid``: optional. A string ID which refers to
    ``bin/langpacks/installer/<lang>.xml``. If it is defined, the message
    will be displayed in the InstallPanel whilst performing the ant call.

In addition to the possible attributes there are some elements. All elements
can be defined more than one time in one ``<antcall>``. All are optional, but
with no ``<target>`` element the ``<antcall>`` makes no sense. Do not confuse
the following: "required"s are related to the attributes of the elements, not
to the elements themselfs.



``<property>``: define a property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Property to be used with all ``target``s and ``uninstall_target``s which are
defined for this antcall.

-   ``name``: required. The name (id) of the property.
-   ``value``: required. The value of the property.



``<propertyfile>``: define properties in a file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Properties to be used with all targets and uninstall_targets which are
defined for this antcall given by the path of a properties file.

-   ``path``: required. Path of a file which contains properties in the
    syntax which is used by ant. Some ant calls need properties files. For
    these this element is used. One way to fill specific data into it is to
    create a new file in a custom panel and fill it with values given by
    input fields. The file path can be set at installation time, if there is
    a variable in AntActionSpec.xml and an IzPack variable was defined before
    InstallPanel. That file can be only created with deleteOnExit, if no
    ``<uninstall_target>`` was defined in this `` <antcall>``. This implies,
    that other ``<antcall>``s can have a ``<uninstall_target>``.



``<target>``: target to call at installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Targets to perform with this antcall at installation time. The targets should
be defined in the given buildfile or else an ant exception will be raised.
This is that what you use, if you don't want to perform the default target.
e.g. cleaning the ``IzPack`` project with ``ant clean``

-   ``name``: required. The name of the target.



``<uninstall_target>``: target to call on uninstallation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Targets to perform with this antcall at uninstallation time. The targets
should be defined in the given buildfile otherwise an ant exception will be
raised. With this target it will be possible to undo the things done at
installation time.

-   ``name``: required. The name of the uninstall target.


Registry access (InstallerListener and UninstallerListener)
===========================================================

The event package of ``IzPack`` contains an installer and an uninstaller
listener for Windows registry access. The listeners uses the separated pack
*com.coi.tools* which is also available as source under the src subtree of
``IzPack``. The registry will be called by JNI.

The registry stuff was implemented in all conscience, but certainly WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND

The listeners themselves are only able to write into the Windows registry at
installation and delet the writing at uninstall time. But it is also possible
to use the registry handler as a registry reader in custom panels or costum
actions. The `CheckedHelloPanel`_ reads the registry and can be used as
example for it.

To add registry support to an installation some changes in the installation
definition file (often called``install.xml``) are to be made. First the
declaration of the listener themselves:

::
    <listeners>
        <listener installer="RegistryInstallerListener"
            uninstaller="RegistryUninstallerListener" >
            <os family="windows"/>
        </listener>
    </listeners>


It is also recomanded to add the uninstaller listener because it is usual to
cleanup the registry at uninstallation. The listeners are only used on
Windows, therefore we declare it.

As with other listeners a jar file with the same name has to exist in
``[IzPackRoot]/bin/customActions``. If compilation (packaging) fails with an
"not found" error, verify, that the jar file exists. If not, create it. The
jar files are ``RegistryInstallerListener.jar`` and
``RegistryUninstallerListener.jar``.

As second change in ``install.xml`` we have to declare the native part JNI
needs the dll

::
    <native type="3rdparty" name="COIOSHelper.dll" stage="both">
        <os family="windows"/>
    </native>


The dll should be placed in ``[IzPackRoot]/bin/native/3rdparty``. The stage
"both" marks this dll not only to be put into the installation jar file but
also to be put into the uninstallation jar file. This will automatically be
performed by the packager and installation.

With these two changes the registry support will be incorporated into your
installation. Without any more actions an uninstall key will be crated in the
registry at the installation. If you open the software manager of Windows,
there will be an entry with the variables $APP_NAME $APP_VER, e.g.:

::
    IzPack 4.6.8 (build 2007.02.15)


The variables will be defined from the entries <appname> and <appversion> in
the <info> element of the installation definition file.

If you would like to have more informations in the uninstaller key or to
create other keys or values in the registry, you should create a
specification file. The file should be then refered to in ``install.xml`` as
resource:

::
    <resources>
        ...
        <res src="mySubPath/MyRegistrySpec.xml"
        id="RegistrySpec.xml"/>
    </resources>


The id has to be ``RegistrySpec.xml``. The real file name is not of any
importance but should be written the same as in your source tree. It will be
securer if you do not use special chars like blanks or umlauts. Be aware! If
you forget to refer to ``registrySpec.xml`` in your ``install.xml`` no
exception will be made because this is a facultative file


The Basic XML Struture
--------------------------

The specification file for registry entries will be defined in the resource
with the id "ReigstrySpec.xml". Sometimes it will help to lock into
``[IzPackRoot]/src/dtd/event/registry.dtd`` or validate a written xml file
with the dtd.

On this xml file a substitution will be performed using all defined
``IzPack`` variables. It is performed just before processing the packs. This
is a common way of loading spec files into custom actions. For more
information see method ``com.izforge.izpack.util.SpecHelper.readSpec``. If
you want to substitute some custom item, simply add a variable via
idata.setVariable in a custom panel before ``InstallPanel``. The given
variable name (id) should be written into the xml file in the common variable
notation.

The top level XML section is called ``<registry>``. Only one is possible. The
``<registry>`` is segregated in one or more ``<pack>`` elements. The single
attribute ``<name>`` of the ``<pack>`` corresponds to the same structure in
install.xml (for more information see also installation.dtd). Only the
"things" included in the ``<pack>`` are performed, if a pack with the same
name was chosen to be installed. Valid "things" are <key> <value>.

The registry stuff self allows to create keys and values directly under a
registry root. But Windows self allows this not on "real" roots like
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_USERS. Only link like roots as HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
are writeable. A try e.g. on HKLM will be cause an exception and the
installation fails. The error number in this case normally will be 87 with
the meaning "wrong parameter", not "permission denied".

We do NOT recommend to create a key or a value directly on a registry root.
IzPack allows it now as a result of some user requests about it. Most it is
not needed. E.g. an extension entry under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT is really an
entry on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes. Why not write directly
there?Reading is in opposite to writing no problem.


``<key>``: define a key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key to be set at installation time into the Windows registry.

-   ``keypath`` : required. The path of the key in Windows syntax without
    the root.
If the key should be placed directly under a registry root (`not recommended;
often not possible)`_) write the key name without any backslash.
-   ``root`` : required. The root of the key as symbol. Valid is one of
    HKCR HKCU HKLM HKU HKPD HKCC HKDDS.


``<value>``: define a value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Value to be set at installation time into the Windows registry.

-   ``name`` : required. The name of the value to be set or modified
    without a path.
The default value will be written as the empty string "".
-   ``keypath`` : required. The key path under which the value should be
    placed in Windows syntax without the root and value name. If the key of
    the value should be placed directly under a registry root (if not exist,
    `not recommended; often not possible)`_) write the key name without any
    backslash.
If the value should be placed directly under a registry root (also not
recommended and often not possible) write as keypath the empty string "".
-   ``root`` : required. The root of the key as symbol. Valid is one of
    HKCR HKCU HKLM HKU HKPD HKCC HKDDS.
-   ``override`` : optional. Override an existent value or not. Valid is
    "true" or "false", default is "true".
-   ``Contents part``: accurately one of the following content elements
    should be defined. It implicit defines the type of the value.

    -   ``string`` : contents for value to be set if it is a string.
    -   ``dword`` : contents for value to be set if it is an integer
    (Windows DWORD). Only digits are valid. "48" is valid, "0x30" will be
    raise an NumberFormatException from ``java.lang.Long.parseLong``.
    -   ``<bin>`` : element to handle one "line" of binary data.

        -   ``data`` : contents for value of type BINARY written as
        comma separated list of hex. Only hex-digits are valid. "48, f4" is
        valid, "0x48, 0xf4" will be raise an NumberFormatException from
        ``java.lang.Integer.parseInt``.

    -   ``<multi>``: element to handle one contents string for
    MULTI_STRINGs.

        -   ``data`` : the contents for the element <multi>.

May be the descriptions for type BINARY and MULTI_STRING are not fully
descriptive. Therefore as example the test entries in the registry
specification file of IzPack:

::
    <registry>
      ...
      <pack name="Core">
        <value name="Path"
          keypath="SOFTWARE\IzForge\IzPack\$APP_VER"
          root="HKLM"
          string="$INSTALL_PATH"/>
        <value name="DWORD"
          keypath="SOFTWARE\IzForge\IzPack\$APP_VER"
          root="HKLM"
          dword="42"/>
        <value name="BIN"
          keypath="SOFTWARE\IzForge\IzPack\$APP_VER"
          root="HKLM" >
          <bin data="42, 49, 4e, 20, 54, 45, 53, 54" />
          <bin data="42, 49, 4e, 20, 54, 45, 53, 54" />
        </value>
        <value name="MULTI"
          keypath="SOFTWARE\IzForge\IzPack\$APP_VER"
          root="HKLM" >
          <multi data="A multi string with three elements" />
          <multi data="Element two"/>
          <multi data="Element three"/>
        </value>
      </pack>
    </registry>

Extended Uninstall Key
----------------------

There is a special pack named ``UninstallStuff``. If a pack will be declared
like

::<pack name="UninstallStuff">

the incorporated elements will be used for creating the uninstall key and
values instead of the build-in behavior. This pack name should be not used at
an other point of the installation. It is a virtual and should be used only
in ``RegistrySpec.xml``.

The registry handler self cannot ensure the uniqueness of an uninstaller key.
There is the special panel ``CheckedHelloPanel`` which does it. If no pack
``UninstallStuff`` will be used, this will be performed full automatically.
If the pack was declared, **all** keypaths under it should be written as
following:

::
    ...
    <value name="DisplayName"
      keypath="SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\$UNI
      NSTALL_NAME"
      root="HKLM"
      string="$UNINSTALL_NAME"/>
    ...


The IzPack variable ``$UNINSTALL_NAME`` will be defined in the
``CheckedHelloPanel``. With the "normal" ``HelloPanel`` it is undefined and
the uninstall key catches the name "$UNINSTALL_NAME".


Uninstall Behavior
------------------

During uninstallation the deletion or modification of written keys or values
will be performed depending to the following rules:

-   A review of the registry will be performed only on supported
    operating systems (current only on Windows).
-   A review of the registry will be performed only if the registry stuff
    was bound for uninstallation.
-   Keys: Keys can only be deleted, a modification is not possible.

    -   A previous existent key will be NOT deleted.
    -   A newly created key will be deleted, if...

        -   no new values or subkeys are added after installation.
        -   no changes are made at the contents of values after
        installation.

        With other words: if under the key something was changed
        between installation and uninstallation, the key will be persist.

-   Values:

    -   A newly created value will be deleted, if the contents at
    uninstall time is the same as after installation.
    -   The contents of a previos existent value will be changed to the
    previos contents (the contents before installation) if the contents at
    uninstall time is the same as after installation.

    With other words: if the contents of a value was changed between
    installation and uninstallation this contents will be persist. There is
    no handling of parts of the contents (important for type MULTI_STRING).

This conservative behavior cannot be changed to a user dependant voting
because there is no user interface for custom actions at uninstall time.
Additional the registry handler to not support voting.


Examples
--------

There are the files

::
    [IzPackRoot]/src/dist-files/IzPack-install-reg.xml
    [IzPackRoot]/src/dist-files/RegistrySpec.xml


``IzPack-install-reg.xml`` contains additional to the normal definition the
stuff needed to create an ``IzPack`` installer which sets on Windows an
extended uninstall key and some keys and values under a "private" key.
Compare with the "normal" installation definition of IzPack.

``RegistrySpec.xml`` will be referred by ``IzPack-install-reg.xml`` as
resource. It contains the special pack named ``UninstallStuff`` for Izpack
and defines some additional keys and values.


Summary Logger (InstallerListener)
=

The listener ``SummaryLoggerInstallerListener`` can be used to log the
`summary of panels`_ into a file. To use it, add following element to the
listener section of your installation config file.

::
    <listeners>
        <listener installer="SummaryLoggerInstallerListener"
            uninstaller="SummaryLoggerInstallerListener" >
            <os family="windows"/>
        </listener>
    </listeners>


The default path is

::$INSTALL_PATH/Uninstaller/InstallSummary.htm

It can be changed with the subelement ``summarylogfilepath`` of the element
``info`` of the installation description file. As example:

::
    <info>
        ...
        <summarylogfilepath>
            $INSTALL_PATH/Uninstaller/MySummary.htm
        </summarylogfilepath>
    </info>

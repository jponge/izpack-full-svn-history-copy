TestLangPacks utility for IzPack installation program
=====================================================

This file is the help file for IzPack developers who want to translate
language files.


Possibilities:
1) just translate language file
2) develop or investigate utility


1) Just translate language file
   ----------------------------
   Read the file: izpack-translators.txt

   As a developer you can update language files using subversion (svn)
   client program. Language files are located at:

   http://svn.codehaus.org/izpack/izpack-src/trunk/bin/langpacks/installer/

   Please note that IzPack could have beta release tag which can
   also contain its own language files. Beta release could be the
   release which is updated more frequently than codes in trunk. But
   after actual release has been came out, its codebase is merged into
   trunk. This might be the reason why there could be untranslated
   strings when version will come out.

   Only developers can update language files (and other source files)
   into subversion database. Others have to make JIRA issue and
   include the file into it. To make JIRA issue and what to fill into
   it please read "4) JIRA issue" in the file izpack-translators.txt.


2) Develop or investigate utility
   ------------------------------

   Developing TestLangPacks
   ------------------------
   TestLangPacks utility is under maintenance of IzPack Installer. You
   can get from Codehaus.org:

      https://svn.codehaus.org/izpack/izpack-testlangpacks/trunk

   You need client software which has "subversion" functionality (e.g.
   TortoiseSVN in Windows).

   Test and beta versions can be obtained from Snapshot area (if any):

      http://snapshots.dist.codehaus.org/izpack/testlangpacks


   Hint for debugging
   ------------------
   If you debug this routine inside Eclipse current working directory
   will be project directory: for example workspace\IzPack-
   TestLangPacks. All file operations will be done to this directory
   if file with path isn't specified in the command line of the
   TestLangPacks.jar. If omitting path you have to copy all needed
   language files into project root directory.


Version checking: advanced
--------------------------
   In addition to izpack-translators.txt file guidance concerning
   version checking you can check the version of the jar file. Open
   TestLangPacks.jar with GUI zip utility (WinZip or equivalent) or
   unzip the jar content into somewhere. See the content of the file:

      /meta-inf/Manifest.mf

   Find attribute: "Implementation-Version".


How to follow-up language file changes
--------------------------------------
   If you follow-up language files in trunk
   (http://svn.codehaus.org/izpack/izpack-src/trunk/bin/langpacks/installer/)

   all your translations won't perhaps be in your language file.

   One solution is to subscribe to IzPack developer mailing list
   (dev@izpack.codehaus.org) which will have announcement when
   branch is scheduled to happen. Before that branch you will make
   desired translations if any.

   Mailing lists are found at:

      http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/izpack/lists

   Mailing list announce@izpack.codehaus.org will have announcements
   about IzPack releases. Do not rely on these messages: when you
   receive this message you are late to do translations.

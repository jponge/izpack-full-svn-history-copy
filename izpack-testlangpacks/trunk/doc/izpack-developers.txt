TestLangPacks utility for IzPack installation program
=====================================================

This file is the help file for IzPack developers who want to translate
language files.


Possibilities:
1) just translate language file
2) develop or investigate utility


1) Just translate language file
   ----------------------------
   Read the file: izpack-translators.txt


2) Develop or investigate utility
   ------------------------------
   To update language files use Update in your subversion (svn) client
   program.


   Developing TestLangPacks
   ------------------------
   TestLangPacks utility is under maintenance of IzPack Installer. You
   can get from Codehaus.org:

      https://svn.codehaus.org/izpack/izpack-testlangpacks/trunk

   You need client software which has "subversion" functionality.

   Test and beta versions can be obtained from Snapshot area (if any):

      http://snapshots.dist.codehaus.org/izpack/testlangpacks


   Hint for debugging
   ------------------
   If you debug this routine inside Eclipse current working directory
   will be project directory: for example workspace\IzPack-
   TestLangPacks. All file operations will be done to this directory
   if file with path isn't specified in the command line of the
   TestLangPacks.jar. If omitting path you have to copy all needed
   language files into project root directory.


Version checking advanced
-------------------------
   In addition to izpack-translators.txt file guidance concerning
   version checking you can check the version of the jar file. Open
   TestLangPacks.jar with GUI zip utility (WinZip or equivalent) or
   unzip the jar content into somewhere. See the content of the file:

      /meta-inf/Manifest.mf

   Find attribute: "Implementation-Version".

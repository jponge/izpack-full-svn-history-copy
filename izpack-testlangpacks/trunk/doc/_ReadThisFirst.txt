Purpose
-------

This utility is indend to help in translating and testing IzPack
language files. The program will produce listings which can be used to
find strings which must be translated. Also other testings are done
for the specified language file.

This utility is under maintenance of IzPack installer:
- http://izpack.org/
- http://izpack.codehaus.org/

Documentation
-------------

This documentation has been devided into two files: for those who just
want to translate IzPack installer and for those who are developers or
who have source files of IzPack.

The translators should read the file: izpack-translators.txt

   and

persons who have the source files: izpack-developers.txt


Note for the both groups
------------------------

ALWAYS use editor which is character encoding aware. This kind of
editors are for example Eclipse and NetBeans. Also commercial editors
MS Visual Studio 200x IDE and Altova XML Editor are suitable for these
tasks.

To fail in character encoding will not produce correct characters
especially with international characters.

-----------------------
Features of the program
-----------------------

Checks well-formness of the language files.
Finds ID's which should be added.
Finds ID's which are not needed anymore.
Finds unknown attributes in elements.
Finds unknown elements (means elements which are not supported).
Check only base file (no other xml files needed).
Finding possible same strings (finding with last word in the ID which
   consists of two words or more, e.g. id="CheckedHelloPanel.headline"
   so "headline" words are searched. This helps to find translations
   in same context to check if they are translated as a same way. This
   is helpfull when there have been several persons translating the
   language file).

The program is totally independent: it won't need any IzPack's classes
to compile or run.


To get help
-----------
In command line write:

   java -jar TestLangPack.jar -?
or
   java -jar TestLangPack.jar -h

to get current command line switches available.


Future features
---------------
Ability to check all IzPack's language files found at once.
Ignore list for finding same strings.


------------
Requirements
------------

To run: Java 5.

A Simple example with custom panel

  This example shows how to compile, package, and place custom panel jars and its dependencies
  to staging area to be picked up by standalone compiler.
  
  Before the starting of izpack compiler at the end of package phase: 
  
  * Custom panel files are compiled implicitly at compile phase.
  
  * Explicitly use maven-jar-plugin to package custom panel jar according to 
    {{{http://www.nabble.com/Adding-custom-panels-without-rebuilding-standalone-compiler.jar-td18297470.html}this}}

  * Use maven-dependency-plugin to copy custom panel's dependencies ( in this example, 
    plexus-utils.jar) to a location in staging area to be picked up by izpack's jar tag.

  * Use maven-antrun-plugin to copy other files to staging area.

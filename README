[ IzPack SVN repository layout ]

Every module owns a subdirectory whose layout is the following:

trunk/    ---------> This is where the 'main' development occurs.

branches/ ---------> This is where the branches live. The branches can
                     be used for making experiments as well as doing
                     some maintenance for a major release. Once a branch
                     is useless (for instance its changes have been merged
                     in 'trunk') it has to be deleted.

tags/     ---------> This is used to provide a reference for each
                     release that is made on the module. Once a tag is
                     made, its content must never be modified.

The modules hosted in the repository are:
- izpack-launcher: the IzPack native launcher project
- izpack-frontend: the IzPack frontend project.

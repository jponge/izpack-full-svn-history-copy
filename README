[ IzPack SVN repository layout ]

Every module owns a subdirectory whose layout is the following:

trunk/    ---------> This is where the 'main' development occurs.

branches/ ---------> This is where the branches live. The branches can
                     be used for making experiments as well as doing
                     some maintainance for a major release.

tags/     ---------> This is used to provide a reference for each
                     release that is made on the module. Once a tag is
                     made, its content should never be modified.

The modules hosted in the repository are:
- izpack-launcher: the IzPack native launcher project.
